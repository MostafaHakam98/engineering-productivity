# Editor Tools

Productivity tips, shortcuts, and workflows for code editors.

## What's Included

### [vscode/](./vscode/) - Visual Studio Code
VSCode-specific productivity tips and keyboard shortcuts.

## Structure

This directory is organized by editor:
- `vscode/` - Visual Studio Code tips and shortcuts

## Adding New Editors

To add tips for other editors:
1. Create a new directory: `mkdir editor/<editor-name>`
2. Add a README.md with editor-specific documentation
3. Add markdown files with tips and shortcuts

## Philosophy

- **Keyboard-first**: Minimize mouse usage
- **Learn incrementally**: Master a few shortcuts at a time
- **Customize**: Adjust keybindings to match your workflow
- **Share**: Document your own discoveries
