# engineering-productivity
A practical, version-controlled collection of workflows, automations, and tools that reduce friction in daily engineering work.  This repository treats productivity as a system: browser-level automation, editor-level refactors, shell workflows, and knowledge shared as code — all designed to be reviewable, reproducible, and installable.
